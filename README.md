# MPMxDEM

MPMxDEM is a versatile solution for running Material Point Method (MPM) simulations with classical constitutive models. Additionally, it offers the capability to integrate 2D/3D Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations with periodic boundary conditions within an MPM simulation. This integration allows for the live generation of a digitally homogenized constitutive law.

## Features

- Run MPM 2D or 3D simulations with classical constitutive models.
- Integrate 2D/3D DEM simulations with periodic boundary conditions within an MPM simulation.
- Live-generation of digitally homogenized constitutive laws.
