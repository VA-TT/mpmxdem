# Boost C++ Libraries

The Boost project provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.

We emphasize libraries that work well with the C++ Standard Library. Boost
libraries are intended to be widely useful, and usable across a broad spectrum
of applications. The Boost license encourages both commercial and non-commercial use
and does not require attribution for binary use. 

The project website is www.boost.org, where you can obtain more information and
[download](https://www.boost.org/users/download/) the current release.
